This website was made by Lily Neusaenger using Next.js.

This is the repository for what will soon be the website for Duke's Book Club. It will keep members up to date on the current club readings, allow members to vote on future reads, and maintain an archive of books read in the past.

In the future, features will be added to allow members to post blog-type posts about their thoughts on the current readings or any other interesting book-related thoughts they may have.
